| **JavaScript Plugins** | Foundation comes with a set of JavaScript plugins that enhance the functionality of your web projects. These plugins are designed to work seamlessly with the Foundation components and include features like Reveal (modal dialogs), Interchange (responsive content loading), Orbit (image sliders), Equalizer (equal height elements), and Magellan (sticky navigation). |
| **Accessibility** | Foundation is built with accessibility in mind, ensuring that web applications are usable by people with disabilities. The framework follows best practices for accessible web design and provides ARIA attributes and keyboard navigability out of the box. |
| **Customizability** | Foundation is highly customizable. Developers can easily modify the default styles and settings to match their project's requirements. The framework's settings file allows for extensive customization of colors, typography, spacing, and more. |
